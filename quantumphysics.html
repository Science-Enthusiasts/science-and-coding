        <h2>Introduction </h2>
        <p>Quantum physics is a branch in physics that provides a description of the physical properties
             of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including 
             quantum chemistry,quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.</p>

    <h2 class="history">How did quantum physics started?</h2>
    <p>
        The phrase "quantum physics" was first used in Johnston's Planck's Universe in Light of Modern Physics (1931).

In 1923, the French physicist Louis de Broglie put forward his theory of matter waves by stating 
that particles can exhibit wave characteristics and vice versa. This theory was for a single particle 
and derived from special relativity theory. Building on de Broglie's approach, modern quantum mechanics 
was born in 1925, when the German physicists Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan developed matrix 
mechanics and the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger invented wave mechanics and the non-relativistic
 Schrödinger equation as an approximation of the generalised case of de Broglie's theory.
 Schrödinger subsequently showed that the two approaches were equivalent. The first applications of
  quantum mechanics to physical systems were the algebraic determination of the hydrogen spectrum by 
  Wolfgang Pauli
 and the treatment of diatomic molecules by Lucy Mensing.

    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Physicists are exploring the potential of quantum science to transform our view of gravity and 
    its connection to space and time. Quantum science may even reveal how everything in the universe 
    (or in multiple universes) is connected to everything else through higher dimensions that our senses
     cannot comprehend.Quantum mechanics is an important tool to understand at the theoretical level the
      electronic structure of chemical compounds and the mechanism, thermodynamics,
      and kinetics of chemical reactions.</p>

<h2>
    Applications of Quantum Physics
</h2>
<p>
    Quantum mechanics has had enormous success in explaining many of the features of our universe, with regards
     to small-scale and discrete quantities and interactions which cannot be explained by classical methods.Quantum mechanics is 
     often the only theory that can reveal the individual behaviors of the subatomic particles that make up all forms of matter (electrons, protons, neutrons,
      photons, and others). Solid-state physics and materials science are dependent upon quantum mechanics.
In many aspects modern technology operates at a scale where quantum effects are significant. Important applications of quantum theory include quantum 
chemistry, quantum optics, quantum computing, superconducting magnets, light-emitting diodes, the optical amplifier and the laser, the transistor and semiconductors such 
as the microprocessor, medical and research imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopy.
 Explanations for many biological and physical phenomena are rooted
 in the nature of the chemical bond, most notably the macro-molecule DNA.
